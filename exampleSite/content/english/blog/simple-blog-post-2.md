Have you ever apologised for your ‘bad’ English?
You know, those situations where:

You’ve written an email to a supplier requesting information and you end the email with “Sorry for my English. I hope you can understand my email.”
 
You’re on the telephone to a client and they ask you “what do you mean” and you respond by apologising first “ Sorry, my English is not very good. What I mean is…”
 
You’re in a meeting and you’ve just given a brief update on a project your team’s working on. One of your colleagues asks you a question that you don’t understand. You automatically assume it’s because of your ‘bad’ English skills and reply: “I’m sorry, but my English is not very good. Can you repeat that?”
 
Why did you apologise? Let me guess.
 
You were so conscious of making mistakes in English that you thought by blaming your ‘bad’ English for those mistakes, the other person would understand better why you’re making those mistakes and have more sympathy for you. 
You so badly wanted to make a positive impression on your audience that you thought if you apologised for your ‘poor’ English, they would treat you more leniently and give you a chance.
You thought if you apologised beforehand for your English, any lack of clarity would be blamed on your language mistakes and NOT on your message. This, you think, would be more acceptable.

> Why “ritual apologies” don’t bring forgiveness.

We all have a deep need to be approved by our peers, and one way we seek their approval is by apologising for our weaknesses in the hope that they (our weaknesses) and, in turn, we will be accepted.
 
The problem with, what some people call, “ritual apologies” is that they end up making us look weak, less confident and, worse still, annoy our listener. Let’s face it, no one wants to hear whiny excuses, especially in the corporate world.
 
Furthermore, by apologising for your English, you’re placing the spotlight on something they may NOT have noticed in the first place.
 
But now you’ve highlighted your ‘bad’ English, the spotlight will stay there and NOT on your true message. Every grammar, pronunciation or word mistake will be scrutinised and picked out like a shining beacon for the world to see!
 
The very thing you didn’t want to happen has happened. You’re being judged not for your professional expertise, but for your ‘bad’ English.
