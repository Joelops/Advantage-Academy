I think if I speak fast, people won’t notice my accent.

“Is it ‘of’ or ‘in’”? – I constantly worry about prepositions.

“What T means is…” – Why do my colleagues feel the need to rephrase what I say? It only serves to undermine me.

And because I feel people won’t understand me or the words I’ve used, I rephrase everything I say which means I end up speaking more and confusing people even more.

I feel so frustrated when I can’t find the right word at that crucial moment. I know it but it won’t reveal itself.

I know I need to slow my speaking speed and pause more. I need to allow my colleagues the time to digest what I’ve just said. But I don’t know how.

Plus, my boss has told me that I need to improve my English communication skills. But I have been doing this job for years.

As my potential client is sharing her concerns and anxieties with me, she keeps asking me if I understand what she’s saying and if the preposition she’s used is right.

What I am hearing, instead, is deep self-criticism, self-doubt and shame.

➜ Shame that she’s not a better communicator.

➜ Shame that she’s letting her colleagues down.

➜ Shame that she’s letting herself down.

➜ Shame that her experience and expertise are being suppressed by her ‘bad’ English.

➜ Shame that after all these years her communication skills are being questioned.

The trouble with feeling shame is that you retreat inwards. You become obsessed with yourself and your imperfections. You get yourself into a web of self-doubt and can’t find a way to untangle yourself. You’re in a maze and can’t find your way out.

There is a LOT of psychological baggage that needs to be unpacked.

Where do you start?

First, you forget about those English prepositions and your words. It’s hard, but do it.

Second, you turn outwards and focus on your audience. You focus on what they need from you and how you can help them with your expertise. On how much they need that expertise.

Then, with the English you have, you go through 4 fundamental steps.

D4 fundamental steps to overcome shame and restore your confidence.
Select a business meeting you had recently where you struggled to communicate effectively and confidently. Where your fear of making a grammar or vocabulary mistake left you frozen.

What was the message you wanted to share? What did you want your audience to do with the message? What was the outcome you were seeking?

Write them down.

Now, go back to square one. Pretend you’ve gone back in time to before the meeting and follow the steps below
