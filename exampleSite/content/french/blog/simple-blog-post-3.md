I ealised my audience didn’t care about my English grammar. They were more interested in understanding my message.

I couldn’t believe it when Giorgios uttered those words in our catch-up call two weeks ago. For the 2 years we worked together, Giorgios was obsessed with achieving perfect English grammar, using the latest buzzwords and acquiring a more sophisticated vocabulary in his business presentations. Despite my attempts to get him to focus on communicating with the English he had. He believed, as many international speakers of English like you do, that in order to be taken seriously in the international world and to build a credible reputation, he absolutely needed to be fluent and grammar-perfect in English. I can totally see why he thought that. For years, you and he were told the only way to succeed in the international business world was to master the English Language. To master its grammar and speak mistake-free English. So you’ve spent years and hard-earned cash on language courses, hours poring over vocabulary lists, grammar worksheets and phrasal verbs desperately trying to achieve the ‘nirvana’ of grammar perfection. Of speaking English like a native speaker. But all it’s done is erode your self-confidence as a business professional. Back to Giorgios. Armed with this misleading belief, he embarked on the next phase of his career – the international market with trepidation.

Here’s what Giorgios did at the beginning.
n his new role, he had to give many presentations to his co-workers. He was eager to make a good impression on them not only with the content but also with his English.

He spent hours on each presentation, double checking his grammar, researching more sophisticated language and buzzwords to dazzle his audience. It was exhausting and… it didn’t work.

His business message simply wasn’t getting through to his audience. They kept asking more and more clarifying questions and he became more and more frustrated.

What was going wrong? He remembered what I’d said all those years ago about communication and decided to go back to the drawing board. He took each presentation and carefully analysed them: the content, his presenting style, his audience, their reaction.
